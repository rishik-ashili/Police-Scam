This project demonstrates a system designed to detect and combat “Digital Arrest Scam” phone and video calls in real time. The solution aims to protect individuals from fraudulent calls by analyzing incoming communication for suspicious keywords, verifying caller identity, and facilitating quick reporting to the authorities.

Key Features  
1. **Real-Time Monitoring**  
   - Automatically initiates brief recordings or screenshots when a cellular or WhatsApp call begins.  
   - Checks both voice (via speech-to-text) and video streams to detect scam elements such as impersonation or suspicious keywords (e.g., “gireftaar,” “chalaan”).  

2. **AI Analysis Engine**  
   - Converts audio to text and looks for scam-related keywords from an extensive list.  
   - Screenshots are analyzed for police uniform or other signs of impersonation.  
   - Triggers alerts when the scam likelihood exceeds a set threshold (e.g., 60%) and generates reports for law enforcement.  

3. **Caller Verification**  
   - Maintains a registry of authentic police or official numbers, displaying a distinct symbol on screen for legitimate callers.  
   - Supports quick user decisions by highlighting potential fraud or confirming authenticity.  

4. **Reporting Mechanism**  
   - Automatically contacts the National Cybercrime Investigation Bureau (NCIB) or the nearest police station when suspicious activity is detected.  
   - Users can manually report scam attempts and forward call recordings for evidence.  

5. **Privacy Considerations**  
   - Non-scam calls and associated recordings can be discarded automatically, preserving user privacy.  
   - Only relevant data is retained and shared with authorities when a scam is detected.  

Future Plans  
- Expand support for multiple Indian languages and international numbers.  
- Include SMS scam detection to identify malicious links.   
- Incorporate advanced location tracking features for real-time police alerts.
